# Consolidated prompt for generating all ORM queries
#<prompt:GenerateAllORMQueries>
# Utilizing the DB_MODELS_PY and context, generate a set of functions to manage database interactions for all entities. This includes:
# - Creating new instances and adding them to the database.
# - Fetching existing instances by ID or other criteria.
# - Updating instance details in the database.
# - Deleting instances from the database.
# The functions should be designed for the CalculationJob, CalculationResult, and FakeLimitOrder models, ensuring comprehensive database operation capabilities for the application.

# It's assumed that DB_MODELS_PY contains the ORM (e.g. SQLAlchemy) models for CalculationJob, CalculationResult, and FakeLimitOrder

# --- Generate ORM Models ---
# The ORM models would be defined here, with each model corresponding to a database table.
# Example:
# class CalculationJob(Base):
#     __tablename__ = 'calculation_jobs'
#     id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
#     # other fields...
    
# class CalculationResult(Base):
#     __tablename__ = 'calculation_results'
#     id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
#     # other fields...
    
# class FakeLimitOrder(Base):
#     __tablename__ = 'fake_limit_orders'
#     id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
#     # other fields...

# Import the ORM models and other dependencies such as session handling.
from db_models import CalculationJob, CalculationResult, FakeLimitOrder
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session

# A database session must be provided by the application setup or a dependency.
# Here we assume that the session is being passed by the caller.

# Similar repository classes should be created for `CalculationResult` and `FakeLimitOrder`.
# They would follow the same pattern as `CalculationJobRepository` with methods for creating,
# retrieving, updating, and deleting records.

# Note the repository pattern used here, where each function deals with one entity at a time.
# This decouples the application logic from the database ORM models and makes it easier to
# unit test the application code.

# Once these repository classes are defined, the application logic would use them to interact
# with the database, rather than using the ORM models directly. This helps to maintain a clean
# separation between the domain logic and the data persistence layer, as dictated by DDD.
